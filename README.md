## Introduction

**TranquilTrack** is a user-friendly application designed to help you monitor and analyse your mood patterns over time. Whether you're interested in self-reflection, mental health awareness, or simply understanding the factors influencing your well-being, Tranquil Track is here to assist you.

### Project Goals

The primary goal of Tranquil Track is to create a user-friendly and impactful mood-tracking application. These goals include:

1. **Comprehensive Well-Being:** Develop a platform that goes beyond traditional mood tracking, incorporating features to log sleep patterns, physical activities, and overall health indicators.

2. **Geolocation Support:** Provide users with valuable information about nearby medical centres and professionals offering mental health support and routine check-ups.

3. **Motivational Rewards:** Implement a reward system within the app to encourage users to maintain consistent engagement, promoting positive mental health habits.

4. **Continuous Reminders:** Design and integrate a reminder system that ensures users are consistently aware of the importance of both mental and physical well-being.

These goals collectively contribute to creating a holistic and supportive environment for users, promoting mental health awareness and well-being.

### Tranquil Track Logo

The Tranquil Track logo is characterised by its soothing green colour, harmonising with the symbolic lotus design. Green, representing nature and renewal, has been chosen intentionally for its positive impact on mental well-being.

**Key Elements:**

- **Colour:** The calm green colour is inspired by nature, promoting feelings of balance and calmness. Green is known to have a positive impact on mood, making it a perfect fit for Tranquil Track.
- **Design:** The lotus symbolizes growth and resilience, making it an uplifting addition to the logo. Tranquil Track encourages you on your path to a brighter mood.
